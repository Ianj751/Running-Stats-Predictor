# Running Statistic Predictor
This uses the scikit and pandas python modules to create a machine learning model that essentially predicts the speed someone will run given distance, average heart rate, and elevation gain. This model predicts with an NRMSE of ~0.0109 indicating the predicted and true values deviate by just 1.09%.
### Technologies Used
Pandas, SciKit, Scipy
